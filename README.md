# Hate-Speech-Classification
A Machine Learning model for Hate Speech Classification



ASSUMPTIONS:

PATH TAKEN IN CODE IS THE RELATIVE PATH USED IN Google Colab.
TOOL: Google Colab

  1) Preprocessing the text documents(the input data) using Count-Vectorizer library and converting the text into vectors.
  2) Spliited the data into training and validation set and applied sklearn library to test hyper parameters validation. 
  3) After that fitted the entire data using the same sklearn library and then predicted on the test data provided after preprocessing the test data.


Key Observations:

Tested with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes library . SVM classifier performs the best for me on my data.
